# Simple Data Entry

How to run:
1. This is a web application built off HTML/CSS/Javascript/C# Coding language and can be run in any IDE.
2. Navigate to the GitHub repository if a link was not already sent, and using the green "Code" button, clone the repository in whichever way works best (I typically use HTTPS as it seems to work the best for me).
3. Once you have the address of the repository copied, paste it into your local IDE to clone the code from the project.
4. After the project files are loaded into your local IDE, you simply need to run them to have the local database entry page appear on your screen.
5. From here, you should be able to use the Web Application as intended.

A simple data entry form that captures and tracks details entered into it, such as Name, Title, Age, and Hometown.

The initial page will have a welcome message with instructions on how to complete the form, as well as 4 fields to enter data

The form requires the data fields: Name and Title, to be filled out prior to submission

Age and Hometown are optional fields and are not required to submit the form

Once this information is entered, it displays a confirmation screen with a table of the last 10 entries in the database.
